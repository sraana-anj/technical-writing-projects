# **Tutorial: How to Write and Format Markdown Files for GitHub Docs**

*Written by- Raana sk*

## Writing documentation doesn’t have to feel like coding. Markdown makes it easy to format text cleanly without touching a single button in Word. It’s lightweight, fast, and used everywhere — especially on GitHub.

## This tutorial walks you through how to write and format Markdown files for GitHub documentation, even if you’ve never used it before.

##  **Step 1: Create a Markdown File**

Open **VS Code**, **Notepad**, or any plain text editor.  
Save a new file with the extension `.md` — for example:

 `my-first-markdown.md`

That’s it. You’ve created your first Markdown file. Easy win.

##  **Step 2: Write a Title**

Use a `#` before your title.

`# My First Markdown File`

The number of `#` symbols decides the heading size:

`## Smaller Heading`    
`### Even Smaller Heading`

*(Pro tip: Never go crazy with more than 3 levels — it looks messy.)*

---

## **Step 3: Add Some Text**

Just start typing normally for body text.

`This is my first Markdown paragraph.`    
`No fancy buttons needed.`

Press **Enter** twice to start a new paragraph.

---

## **Step 4: Use Lists**

* For bullet points, use a dash `-` or a star `*`.

`- Item one`    
`- Item two`    
`- Item three`

1. For numbered lists, just use numbers.

`1. Step one`    
`2. Step two`    
`3. Step three`

## **Step 5: Add Links and Images**

**Links:**

`[Visit GitHub](https://github.com)`

**Images:**

`![Markdown Logo](https://markdown-here.com/img/icon256.png)`

Always add descriptive alt text in case the image doesn’t load.

---

## **Step 6: Add Code Blocks**

Use backticks (\`) for inline code:

`` To run the program, type `python app.py` ``

For larger code blocks, use triple backticks:

print("Hello Markdown\!")

---

##  **Step 7: Use Bold and Italics**

`**Bold text**`    
`*Italic text*`    
`***Bold and Italic***`

These are great for highlighting key terms in documentation.

---

##  **Step 8: Preview It on GitHub**

1. Upload your `.md` file to a GitHub repo.

2. Click the file — GitHub automatically renders the Markdown beautifully.

3. Congratulations, you’ve just created your first GitHub-friendly document.
